Best Fit Memory Allocation
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Best Fit Memory Allocation algorithm, a dynamic memory management technique used in operating systems. The program efficiently allocates memory to processes by finding the smallest available memory block that can satisfy a process's requirements. It is built using Java and integrated with a MySQL database for persistent storage of allocation logs.

Features
Allocates memory to processes dynamically using the Best Fit algorithm.
Handles unallocated processes and logs them for analysis.
Saves all allocation results (including timestamps) in a MySQL database.
Displays real-time allocation results in the console.
Supports modular design for easy maintenance and scalability.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
Database: MySQL
Dependency Management: Maven
Tools: IntelliJ IDEA, MySQL Workbench
Frameworks/Libraries: MySQL JDBC Driver, JUnit (for testing)
System Requirements
Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or above
MySQL Server: Version 5.7 or above
Disk Space: Minimum 100 MB free storage
Installation and Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/BestFitMemoryAllocation.git
cd BestFitMemoryAllocation
Step 2: Set Up MySQL Database
Install and configure MySQL Server.
Create a database named memory_allocation:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE memory_allocation;
Create the MemoryAllocationLog table:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE MemoryAllocationLog (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    process_id INT NOT NULL,
    process_size INT NOT NULL,
    block_id INT DEFAULT NULL,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Step 3: Configure Database Connection
Open the DatabaseConnection class in the source code.
Update the connection string with your MySQL credentials:
java
Copy code
connection = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/memory_allocation", "root", "your_password"
);
Step 4: Build and Run the Project
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or your preferred IDE).
Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
Run the BestFitWithDatabase class to start the program.
Usage
Input Data:
Enter the number of memory blocks and their sizes.
Enter the number of processes and their sizes.
View Results:
Console: Displays which processes are allocated to which memory blocks.
Database: Logs all allocation details, including unallocated processes.
Testing
The program has been thoroughly tested with various scenarios, including:

Valid memory allocation.
Edge cases like large processes and exact matches.
Database validation for accurate logging. Refer to the "Testing Results" section in the report for detailed outcomes.
Future Enhancements
Add a GUI for better user interaction.
Include process deallocation and memory reorganization features.
Optimize performance for larger datasets.
