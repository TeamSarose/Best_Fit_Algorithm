# Best Fit Memory Allocation Project

This project demonstrates the **Best Fit Memory Allocation** algorithm, a memory management technique used in operating systems to allocate processes to memory blocks efficiently. The project is implemented in **Java** with **MySQL** integration for logging allocation results.

---

## Features

- Implements the **Best Fit** algorithm to allocate processes to the smallest available memory blocks.
- Handles unallocated processes and logs them appropriately.
- Integrates with a **MySQL database** to store allocation results for analysis.
- Provides a modular and scalable code structure using design patterns like **Singleton** and **Factory**.
- Allows dynamic user input for memory blocks and processes.
- Outputs results in the console and logs them persistently in the database.

## Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or above
- **MySQL Server:** Version 5.7 or above
- **IDE (Optional):** IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java-supported IDE
- **Maven:** For dependency management
